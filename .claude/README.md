# Elite Context Engineering System

> **A focused agent is a performant agent. A focused engineer is a performant engineer.**

Welcome to the Elite Context Engineering System - a comprehensive framework for managing agent context windows using the R&D (Reduce and Delegate) methodology.

## Quick Start

```bash
# 1. Prime your agent with focused context
/prime

# 2. Delegate tasks to specialized sub-agents
/delegate code-analyzer src/

# 3. Save context when nearing limits
/bundle-save feature-name

# 4. Invoke expert agents for deep analysis
/expert security-auditor src/
```

## What is Context Engineering?

Context engineering is the practice of managing your agent's context window - the most precious and delicate resource in agent-based development. This system provides:

- **50-80% context reduction** through MCP and priming
- **Efficient task delegation** to specialized agents
- **Agent chaining** via context bundles
- **Multi-agent orchestration** for complex workflows

## The R&D Framework

### REDUCE (R): Minimize Context
- **MCP Server Management**: Offload file/git/database access
- **Context Priming**: Dynamic, focused context loading
- **Slim Memory**: Keep claude.md minimal

### DELEGATE (D): Distribute Work
- **Sub-Agents**: Single-purpose task execution
- **Context Bundles**: Agent handoffs without information loss
- **Expert Agents**: Deep domain specialists
- **Background Agents**: Async monitoring

## Four Proficiency Levels

**Level 1: Beginner (REDUCE)** - 50-80% context reduction
**Level 2: Intermediate (DELEGATE)** - Task-focused delegation
**Level 3: Advanced (R&D)** - Agent chaining via bundles
**Level 4: Agentic (ORCHESTRATION)** - Multi-agent workflows
